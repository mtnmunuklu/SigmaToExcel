status: experimental
description: 'Detects commandline operations on shell history files'
    # Rule detects presence of various shell history files in process commandline
    # Normally user expected to view own history with dedicated 'history' command and not some other tools
    # There is a possibility for rule to trigger, when T1070.003 techinuque is used (history file cleared)
    # For this rule to work execve auditing must be configured
    # Example config (place it at the bottom of audit.rules)
    # -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -k execve
    # -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -k execve
